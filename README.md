## Description 
Hello! This project is called "Password-Gen" and I created this to generate strong passwords for people to use when needed. The page will ask you a couple of questions such as the length you'd want your password to generate, if you want to use lowercase , uppercase, special characters, and finally numbers. Users have the option to choose between these options and it will generate a password base off of the users input options.
